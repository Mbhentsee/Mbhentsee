## 📈 My Coding & Data Journey

After completing my degree, I made the bold decision to pivot into tech. I started from zero—no prior coding experience—just a commitment to learn and build. Since then:

- ✅ Graduated from the **Coursera Certificates**
- ✅ Completed certifications from **Udemy** and **CVS Health**
- ✅ Built and documented several **Excel dashboards**, **data reports**, and **Python scripts**
- ✅ Practised with **real-world datasets** from Kaggle, government sources, and personal research
- ✅ Developed **Streamlit apps** and hosted them for sharing insights interactively
- ✅ Contributed to online coding communities, participated in data challenges, and helped peers debug their work

I see this as a long-term career, not just a job. My goal is to join a team where I can **contribute with data, grow through collaboration, and build solutions that make a real impact.**
